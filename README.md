## Inteligent Agents

The acts of an intelligent agent must be based on reasoning and the conclusions obtained from the information it has.

They make the most convenient decision based on the information and time they have available.

Groups of agents, each with different capabilities, who work together to solve a problem.

### Practice
A smart vacuum cleaner lives in a simple world, two boxes A and B. The vacuum cleaner can sense which box it is in. She can also sense if the painting is dirty.
She can choose whether to move left or right, vacuum up dirt, or do nothing.

Implement a program that represents the vacuum cleaner and its world. And the user can “dirty a quadrant” so that the vacuum cleaner can clean it.

Create two forms of behavior for the vacuum cleaner: Stupid and Smart
